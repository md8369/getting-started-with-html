<b>UNDERSTANDING THE INTERNET</b>

<p>
The internet is a group of computers  sending and receiving messages. When a person types a web page
it travels across the internet to servers. The servers look up the information requested and sends
it back to the browser.

<b>HTML</b>

<p>Hypertext Markup Language is  the <em>heart</em> of the web. 
It contains text content that you can see and markup is how it looks.
</p>

<p><em>HTML</em> documents are created using tags. Tags have an opening and a closing depending on which one you are using. Examples of tags are bold,emphasis, anchor and linkable tags to display images or website.
